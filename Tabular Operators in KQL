- Print: prints the results of a query
- Search:  allows you to search for specific data throughout the logs. Running search queries can help narrow down to the affected table in thelogs something occurs and then a workflow can be used to query it.
    syntax: search n ("tablename") "searchitem"
    
- Where: filters a table to the subset of rows that satisfy a comparison
    syntax: TableName
            |where CounterName = "Free Data"
  The 'Where' operator has allowable predicates that include:
    - string predicates: == , has, contains, matches , regex, endswith, startswith. 
    - numerical/date predicates: == ,  != , < , > , <= , >=
    - empty predicates: isempty(), notempty(), isnull(), notnull()
            
       
- Take/Limit: are similar and used for the smae purpose, it return sup the specified number of rows
    syntax: TableName         or    TableName
            |limit <number>         |take<Number>
- Count: Returns the total numberof times something occurred
    syntax: TableName
             |count 
             
- Summarize: Produces a table that summarizes the content of selected columns: it summarizes data as per columns chosen
    syntax: TableName
            |summarize count() by 'ColumnName1' , 'ColumnName2'
   The 'Summarize' operator can be used alongside aggregayion functions that can be classified as either; simple or advanced
     -  simple agggreagtion functions: count(), sum(), min() and max()
     -  advanced aggregation functions: percentiles(), arg_min(), arg_max(),  make_list(), cointif(), make_set(). 

- Extend: it creates calculated columns and appends them to the result set.
    synatax: TableName
             |extend [ColumnName] = Expression [field]
         
- Project: it's used to select the columns to include, it tells the query engine the exact data columns to show.
     syntax: TableName
             |project column1, column2, column3

- Distinct: it produces a table with the distinct combination to the provided columns of the input table
    syntax: TableName
            |distinct 'field'
- Order/Set: they have no functional differences and they do the same thing. they sort the rows of the input table into order by one or more columns

- Join: it's used to produce more specific results by joining rows of just two tables through matching the values of columns you specify.
    We have left join, full outer join, iner join, right join.
    syntax: LeftTable
            |join [join parameters] (RightTable) on Attributes
- Union: it allows for one to take data from two or more tables and display the results together. 
    syntax: TableNmae1
            |union 'TableName2'
- Render: it allows one to visualize results genearted into charts and graphs. The visualization can be a bar graph, line graph, pie chart etc...
     syntax: TableName
              |render 'visualization'
