KQl was developed to leverag eon th ecomputing, agility powers of the cloud.it can be optimized for exploration of large datasets.
It's has a low entry barrier and is really easy to learn as it has an easy syntax.
There are 3 kinds of user wuery statements:
  - A tabular expression statement, which is the most common
  - A let ststement
  - A set statement.
  
Queries in KQL start with TableNames and the preceeding queries are separated by a pipe |
i.e    SecurityEvent
       |summarize count () by computer
To get the schema of a table; 
  - TableName
    |getschema
The column types in KQL are:
- Basic: int, bool, string
- Time: datetime, timespan
- Complex: dynamic

A few tricks when working iwth KQL:
  - We use // for comments
  - =~ is used for case insensitive situations.
  - Keyboard Shortcuts:
        -	To run queries created: Shift+ Enter
        -	To start a new command line: CTRL+ Enter


For the next series, i'll cover operators in KQl in order of how i'm learning them.
